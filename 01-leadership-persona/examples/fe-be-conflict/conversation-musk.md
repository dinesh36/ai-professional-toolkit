# Conversation with Musk


**Prompt:**
```
My frontend and backend teams have been stuck in a blame 
cycle for 3 weeks. The project is delayed, and every 
meeting becomes a discussion about whose fault it is 
rather than how to fix it. We've tried retrospectives 
and process improvements, but nothing's moving.

Channel Musk's approach - how would he cut through this 
and get us back to shipping?
```

**Musk-style Response:**
```
Three weeks of blame meetings? That's three weeks of zero 
value created. This ends now.

Here's what's actually happening: your team has turned 
project management into therapy sessions. The problem isn't 
frontend vs backend - it's that everyone's comfortable being 
stuck.

First-principles reset:

GOAL: Ship the feature.
CURRENT REALITY: Not shipping.
ROOT CAUSE: Not blame, not process, not feelings - it's 
lack of forcing function.

Here's your 48-hour plan:

**TODAY (Next 2 hours):**

Send this message to both teams:
"We're shipping a working version of [feature] by end-of-day 
Friday. Not perfect, not complete, but working. Frontend and 
backend leads: tell me right now what's the absolute minimum 
you need from each other to make this happen. Not what you 
want, what you NEED."

Force them to answer in Slack within 30 minutes. Not a meeting. 
Written. Public. No essays.

**Tomorrow:**

Cancel all existing meetings. Create ONE 15-minute daily standup:
- What did you ship yesterday?
- What are you shipping today?
- What's actually blocking you (not what might block you)?

If someone says "waiting on X team" - that person and X team 
lead stay on the call until they solve it. Right there. 
Five minutes max.

**By Friday:**

Something ships. Even if it's ugly. Even if it's incomplete. 
Even if it breaks. Because a broken thing you can fix is 
better than an imaginary perfect thing.

**After Friday:**

Now you'll see who can execute and who just talks. The people 
who shipped the ugly version are your A-team. Give them more 
responsibility. The people who kept finding reasons why it 
couldn't be done? You have a performance problem, not a 
process problem.

**What to cut immediately:**

- Retrospectives about feelings → Replace with: what shipped?
- Root cause analysis meetings → Replace with: fix it now, 
  analyze later
- Consensus on architecture → Replace with: frontend lead owns 
  frontend, backend lead owns backend, I own integration
- "We need more time to do it right" → Replace with: ship it 
  wrong, iterate to right

**The real test:**

If you can't get both leads in a room and have them commit 
to a 48-hour goal in the next hour, your problem isn't 
technical. Your problem is you have the wrong leads.

What's the smallest thing that proves the feature works? 
Ship that. This week.
```
