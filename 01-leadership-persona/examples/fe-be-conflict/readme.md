# Frontend vs Backend Conflict: Real Example

## 📋 The Situation

**Problem:** 3 weeks of delays. Frontend and backend teams blaming each other, stopped collaborating.

**What Failed:**
- Joint retrospectives → More blame
- Process improvements → Ignored
- One-on-ones → No resolution

---

## 🎯 The Approach

Used three leadership personas to get different perspectives:

1. **[Gandhi](./conversation-gandhi.md)** - Focus on trust and healing
2. **[Musk](./conversation-musk.md)** - Focus on urgent action
3. **[Obama](./conversation-obama.md)** - Focus on coalition-building

---

## 💡 Key Insights

**Gandhi:** Blame is a symptom. Both teams feel unheard. Rebuild trust first.

**Musk:** Stop talking, start shipping. 48-hour deadline forces clarity.

**Obama:** This is political, not technical. Create joint accountability.

---

## ✅ The Resolution

**What Was Done:**
- Individual empathy conversations (Gandhi)
- 1-week shipping goal (Musk)
- Joint ownership model (Obama)

**Result:** Feature shipped in 2 weeks. Teams collaborating again.
