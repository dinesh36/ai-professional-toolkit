# Conversation with Obama

**Prompt:**
```
My frontend and backend teams are in conflict, blaming each 
other for a 3-week delay. My engineering director is frustrated 
and wants quick accountability. The teams want me to "pick a 
side." Product management is pressuring me about timelines. 
I need to resolve this without losing trust from any side.

Channel Obama's approach - how do I navigate these competing 
pressures and build consensus toward a solution?
```

**Obama-style Response:**
```
You're in a position that every leader faces: multiple 
constituencies, each with legitimate concerns, and no solution 
that makes everyone happy. Welcome to leadership.

Let's map your political landscape:

STAKEHOLDERS & THEIR REAL CONCERNS:
- Engineering Director: Worried about team effectiveness, wants 
  to see leadership from you
- Frontend team: Feeling blamed, want vindication, fear being 
  scapegoated
- Backend team: Also feeling blamed, want recognition of their 
  constraints
- Product Management: Under pressure, needs predictability, 
  doesn't care who's "right"

Your mistake right now: trying to solve the technical problem 
when you actually have a coalition-building problem.

Here's your strategy:

**PHASE 1: Build Your Coalition (Days 1-2)**

Start with individual conversations, not group meetings. Your 
message to each:

To Engineering Director:
"I hear your frustration about this taking three weeks. I'm 
going to handle this, but I'm going to do it in a way that 
builds a stronger team, not just assigns blame. Give me one 
week to turn this around. If you don't see movement, we'll 
discuss more direct intervention."

[This buys you space and shows leadership without capitulation]

To Frontend Team:
"I know you're frustrated. I'm not here to judge who's right. 
I'm here to figure out how we work better going forward. Help 
me understand: if we were designing the ideal collaboration 
from scratch, what would it look like?"

[This validates without agreeing, redirects to future]

To Backend Team:
[Same message - shows fairness]

To Product Management:
"I understand the timeline pressure. Here's what I'm doing to 
address this systematically so we don't have this problem again. 
I'll have a revised timeline for you by end of week."

[Sets expectation, shows you're in control]

**PHASE 2: Frame the Narrative (Day 3)**

Call a joint meeting. Do NOT start with the problem. Start with 
the framing:

"We're here because we have a shared challenge: our current way 
of working across frontend and backend isn't serving anyone well. 
Not you, not me, not our users. I'm not interested in who's at 
fault for the last three weeks. I'm interested in how we work 
differently over the next three months.

Both teams have raised legitimate concerns. Frontend is right 
that API instability makes their work harder. Backend is right 
that unclear requirements set them up to fail. These aren't 
competing truths - they're connected problems.

Here's what I'm proposing..."

[Notice: you acknowledged both sides BEFORE proposing solutions]

**PHASE 3: Shared Ownership (Day 3 continued)**

Your proposal should have three parts:

1. IMMEDIATE (Next 2 weeks):
   "We're going to complete [specific feature] together. Frontend 
   lead and Backend lead: you're co-owners. You succeed together 
   or fail together. I'm removing individual accountability and 
   making it joint."
   
   [This forces collaboration; no one can blame the other]

2. SYSTEMIC (Next 3 months):
   "We're establishing new working agreements. I want both teams 
   to draft what you need from each other. We'll meet next week 
   to align on this."
   
   [Gives them ownership of the solution]

3. ACCOUNTABILITY (Ongoing):
   "Going forward, our metric is joint delivery. Not frontend 
   velocity, not backend velocity - integrated features shipped."
   
   [Changes the incentive structure]

**PHASE 4: Communication Outward (Day 4)**

Update your director:
"I've brought both teams together on a joint accountability 
model. They're now co-owners of delivery. We'll see results 
within two weeks, and I'm putting new working agreements in 
place to prevent this pattern."

Update Product Management:
"We've aligned on a path forward. Here's the revised timeline 
with more realistic dependencies built in."

**THE KEY INSIGHT:**

You don't need to pick a side. You need to make picking sides 
irrelevant by changing the game. When you shift from individual 
accountability to joint accountability, the conflict loses its 
fuel.

**YOUR COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES:**

- Acknowledge legitimate concerns from all sides (builds trust)
- Frame the future, not the past (reduces defensiveness)
- Give ownership of solutions (creates buy-in)
- Be firm on the outcome (show leadership)
- Stay gracious on the process (preserve relationships)

**IF SOMEONE PUSHES BACK:**

"I understand this isn't the answer you wanted. But my job isn't 
to validate one team's position - it's to build a team that works. 
I'm asking you to trust this approach for two weeks. If it's not 
working, we'll revisit."

You're not avoiding the tough call - you're making a tougher 
call: refusing to let them stay divided.

What matters isn't who's right about the past. What matters is 
who's willing to build the future.

That's leadership.
