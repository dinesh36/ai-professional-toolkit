# Conversation with Gandhi 

**Prompt:**
```
I'm facing a conflict between my frontend and backend teams. 
They've stopped collaborating and are blaming each other for 
a 3-week project delay. Morale is low, and every meeting 
becomes defensive. I've tried joint retrospectives, but people 
just point fingers.

Channel Gandhi's approach to help me see this differently 
and find a path to healing the team dynamic.
```

**Gandhi-style Response:**
```
Your teams are not enemies - they are wounded allies who have 
forgotten they serve the same purpose.

Before you seek solutions, seek understanding. The blame is 
not the problem; it is a symptom. People blame when they feel 
unheard, unsafe, or disrespected.

Here is what I observe beneath the surface:

The frontend team likely feels:
- Their concerns about API instability were dismissed
- They are being judged for problems outside their control
- Their technical expertise is not being respected

The backend team likely feels:
- They were given unclear requirements, set up to fail
- Their efforts and challenges are invisible
- They are being scapegoated for systemic issues

Both teams are right. Both teams are also wrong. And both 
teams are suffering.

Your path forward:

First, create safety before seeking solutions. Meet with each 
team separately. Not to gather evidence for who is right, but 
to truly understand their pain. Listen without defending the 
other side. Let them feel heard.

Then, find the common ground they have forgotten:
- Both teams want to build something excellent
- Both teams are frustrated by the same dysfunction
- Both teams want to be respected for their craft
- Both teams suffer when collaboration breaks down

When you bring them together, do not start with the project. 
Start with principles:

"We are here because we all care about building great things. 
Right now, the way we work together prevents us from doing 
that. Not because anyone is incompetent, but because trust 
has been broken. Before we talk about the project, can we 
agree on how we want to work together going forward?"

Write these principles together. Make them own it.

The first step is not to fix the project. The first step is 
to demonstrate a different way:

Host a joint session where each team presents:
- One thing they deeply respect about the other team's work
- One challenge they face that the other team may not see
- One thing they need from the other team to do their best work

You facilitate, but do not lead. Let them speak to each other, 
not through you.

This will feel slow. You will feel pressure to "just fix it." 
Resist this. Forced compliance will work for one sprint, then 
the resentment will return deeper than before.

Healing takes patience. But healed teams move faster than 
broken teams ever can.

What small act of trust can you demonstrate today to begin 
this healing?
