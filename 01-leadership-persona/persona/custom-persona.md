# Custom Persona Template

> **Create your own leadership persona based on leaders you know, admire, or need.**

## 🎯 Why Create Custom Personas?

The pre-built personas (Gandhi, Musk, Obama) are powerful, but sometimes you need:
- **Someone who knows your industry** (e.g., "My former CTO who understood fintech regulations")
- **A specific skillset** (e.g., "That PM who was amazing at customer negotiations")
- **Cultural context** (e.g., "A leader who navigated startup to enterprise transition")
- **A blend of traits** (e.g., "Musk's urgency + Gandhi's empathy")

## 💬 Sample Dialogue

**Your prompt:**
```
I'm dealing with a team culture problem. My engineering team 
has become very territorial - people hoard knowledge, don't 
share learnings, and there's an underlying competitiveness 
that's hurting collaboration. When someone makes a mistake, 
others use it as ammunition rather than a learning opportunity.

Productivity is okay, but innovation has stalled. People are 
afraid to experiment because they don't want to look bad.

Channel Satya's approach to help me shift this culture.
```

**Satya-style Response:**
```
What you're describing is a "know-it-all" culture - people 
protecting their turf instead of learning together. I've seen 
this firsthand, and it's toxic to innovation.

The good news: culture can change. The hard truth: it starts 
with you, and it takes time.

Here's how I'd approach this:

UNDERSTAND THE ROOT CAUSE:

Your team isn't acting this way because they're bad people. 
They're acting this way because something in the environment 
rewards or requires it.

Ask yourself:
- Do people get ahead by hoarding knowledge or sharing it?
- When someone admits a mistake, what actually happens?
- Do I, as the leader, model vulnerability and learning?

If your best performers are the "know-it-alls," you've 
accidentally created this culture through your own incentives.

SHIFT FROM KNOW-IT-ALL TO LEARN-IT-ALL:

Start with yourself. In your next team meeting, share something 
you're learning or struggling with. Make it real, not performative.

"I've been reading about [X], and I'm still trying to figure out 
how it applies to us. Has anyone explored this?"

or

"I made a decision last quarter that didn't work out. Here's what 
I learned..."

This signals: it's safe to not know everything.

CREATE PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY:

Celebrate learning, not just success. When someone shares what 
didn't work:

"Thank you for sharing that. What did you learn? How can we 
apply that insight to other projects?"

Not:
"Why didn't you catch that sooner?"

The difference matters. A lot.

CHANGE THE INCENTIVES:

In your next 1-on-1s, ask:
"What did you learn this month?"
"Who did you help grow?"
"What knowledge did you share?"

Not just:
"What did you ship?"

What you measure is what you'll get.

SMALL WINS BUILD MOMENTUM:

Don't try to transform everything overnight. Start with one 
practice:

Weekly "Learning Share" - 15 minutes where someone shares 
something they learned (from success OR failure). Make it safe, 
make it regular, make it normal.

After 3 months, this becomes "just how we work."

THE LONG GAME:

Culture change doesn't happen in a quarter. It happens through 
consistent signals over time:
- What you celebrate
- What you tolerate
- What you model
- What you measure

If you stay consistent for 6 months, you'll see real change. 
If you waffle or rush back to old patterns under pressure, 
the culture will revert.

YOUR FIRST STEP THIS WEEK:

Share your own learning or mistake in your next team meeting. 
Model the vulnerability you want to see.

Remember: you can't change culture by mandate. You change it 
by modeling, reinforcing, and giving people permission to be 
learners instead of know-it-alls.

This is how great teams are built.
```

## 🎓 Learning from Satya

### Key Takeaways:
- **Culture beats strategy** - Technical solutions fail without healthy culture
- **Model first, mandate never** - Leaders who show vulnerability create psychological safety
- **Patience is strategic** - Rushing culture change breaks trust
- **Measure what matters** - Celebrating learning changes behavior more than celebrating wins alone

### Common Mistakes:
1. **Expecting fast results** - Culture changes slowly; consistency matters
2. **Not modeling behavior** - Telling people to change while you stay the same
3. **Reverting under pressure** - Going back to old patterns when stressed
4. **Measuring only outcomes** - Ignoring behaviors and learning

## 🔗 Combine Satya With:

- **+ Gandhi** = Deep empathy with culture transformation
- **+ Obama** = Culture change with political navigation
- **+ Gates** = Empathy backed by data and systems thinking
